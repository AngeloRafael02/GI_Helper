application/ File Structure:

application/
|-- dist/
|   |-- frontend/
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- backend/
|   |   |-- ...
|-- frontend/
|   |-- src/
|-- backend/
|   |-- src/
|-- package.json
|-- angular.json
|-- nest-cli.json
|-- tsconfig.json (and extensions)

The Angular Framework src/ directory and Nest JS src/ directory are in their separate directories 
(frontend/ and backend/ respectively) but their config file such are all in the application/ directory 
level. Because of this, there are several files that are the same in both frameworks but have different 
content such as the package.json the tsconfig.json. Mostly, the contents of some of the of the config
files of NestJS are merged to config files of the Angular's config files. Otherwise, files unique to 
Nest JS such as the .eslint.js and nest-cli.json are moved to the same directory as the Angular config 
files.
